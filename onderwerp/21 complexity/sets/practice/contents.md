# Practice with sets
> If there is an exercise that you don't know how to solve, review the theory again. If that doesn't help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.

Test your understanding with the following practice exercises. Use your usual code editor and create a file called `sets.py`.

**Exercise 1** Create two sets `firstSet` and `secondSet` with the numbers 23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, and 29, and 57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, and 48 respectively.

**Exercise 2**  Get the intersection of the sets, and save the result in `thirdSet`. Create another set `fourthSet` that holds the difference between `firstSet` and `secondSet`.

**Exercise 3** Add the number 67 to `thirdSet`.

**Exercise 4** Check if `thirdSet` is a subset of `firstSet` and if it is the case print the text "subset!", print the next "not a subset" otherwise.

**Exercise 5** Finally, given the list with double items called `doubles`. Filter for unique items using a set and save the solution as a list in the variable `uniques`.

    doubles = ["tennis", "badminton", "rowing", "soccer", "tennis", "judo", "judo", "karate", "soccer"]
    uniques = # Your solution here
